DO NOT EDIT! -->\n\n### Objective\n\nIt is non-trivial to handle all these data merger and region extraction etc for integrative analysis. I would like to revisit and extend LDtools as a utility package to handle summary stats data in the context of data integration -- including fine-mapping, LDSC, PRS, TWAS.\n\n### Relevant existing tools\n\nLDtools developed by @changebio for our analysis pipelines.\nPolyfun software has some utility functions to compute LD by chunks, with PLINK input format\nhttps://github.com/omerwe/polyfun/blob/master/finemapper.py#L476\nas well as with bgen format in which case ldstore is used\nhttps://github.com/omerwe/polyfun/blob/master/finemapper.py#L385\nbigsnpr::snp_match\nhttps://rdrr.io/github/MichelNivard/GenomicSEM/man/sumstats.html\nhttps://github.com/precimed/python_convert\nhttps://github.com/matthijsz/pysumstats\nhttps://bioconductor.riken.jp/packages/3.14/bioc/vignettes/MungeSumstats/inst/doc/MungeSumstats.html\nGoogle search sumstats or gwas summary statistics there are various repos on github\nAs a user, I would rather use ldsc code than LDtools because at least they are better tested (by application to multiple papers and dataset). I wish LDtools had used some of these code so we don't reinvent the wheel. However, what polyfun/ldsc has is not good enough.\n\nAlso, survey each application fine-mapping, LDSC, PRS, TWAS and comment on how they handle the issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\nLet's take a look at polyfun/ldsc and other related codes, and rework LDtools if their implementation is better. LDtools also contains many other features. Here is the scope of the proposed extended tool:\n\nSupport VCF summary statistics format: convert and combine summary stats in VCF format (possibly through rpy2 to the gwas_vcf R package)\nMerge summary stats and make sign flips deserves a comprehensive discussion\nCompute LD for given region, adjusting for covariates and GRM ; need to support VCF, bgen and plink\nBuilt-in liftover for summary stats or LD index\nOther data integration utility features we use repeatedly in xqtl-pipeline, as we move forward with the analysis\n\n## 1.
